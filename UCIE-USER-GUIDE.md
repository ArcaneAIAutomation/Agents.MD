## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Start with Overview
Always read the executive summary first to get the big picture before diving into details.

### 2. Check Data Quality Score
A score >90% means high-quality, reliable data. <70% means some data sources failed.

### 3. Use Multiple Timeframes
Don't rely on a single timeframe. Check 1h, 4h, and 1d for confirmation.

### 4. Combine Multiple Signals
The best trades have:
- ✅ Bullish technical indicators
- ✅ Positive sentiment
- ✅ Smart money accumulation
- ✅ Positive news flow
- ✅ Low risk score

### 5. Watch for Divergences
When sentiment and price diverge, it often signals a reversal:
- High sentiment + falling price = distribution (bearish)
- Low sentiment + rising price = accumulation (bullish)

### 6. Monitor Whale Activity
Large whale transactions often precede major price moves. Set alerts for whale activity.

### 7. Check Smart Contract Security
For new tokens, always verify smart contract security before investing.

### 8. Use Risk Assessment
Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use risk scores for position sizing.

### 9. Set Alerts
Don't watch charts all day. Set alerts and let UCIE notify you of important events.

### 10. Keep Learning
UCIE provides AI explanations for every metric. Read them to improve your understanding.
