## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- ChatGPT-5.1 API calls should complete within 10 seconds (similar to GPT-4o)
- No degradation in trade signal generation speed

### Reliability
- ChatGPT-5.1 should have ≥95% success rate for valid JSON responses
- Fallback to Gemini AI should activate within 2 seconds of ChatGPT-5.1 failure

### Maintainability
- Model version should be configurable via environment variable only
- No hardcoded model identifiers in code (except defaults)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: ChatGPT-5.1 API Changes
**Mitigation**: Maintain GPT-4o as rollback option via OPENAI_MODEL env var

### Risk 2: Different JSON Output Format
**Mitigation**: Extensive testing with JSON validation and repair logic

### Risk 3: Increased API Costs
**Mitigation**: Monitor usage and costs, implement rate limiting if needed

### Risk 4: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation**: Track response times and compare with GPT-4o baseline
